# HCX Builder Development Rules

## Data Flow Rules
0. Project is the root and can have multiple VCenters
1. VCenter is the parent entity for Clusters
2. Each VCenter can have multiple Clusters
3. Each Cluster can have multiple Network Extensions
4. Network Extensions require NE to be enabled on the Cluster
5. Each VCenter must have unique name
6. Each Cluster within a VCenter must have unique name
6. Each Network Extensions within a Cluster must have unique vlan id

## Validation Requirements
1. IP Address fields must follow standard IPv4 format
2. URLs must start with http:// or https://
3. Version numbers must be in format: X.Y or X.Y.Z
4. Required fields cannot be empty strings
5. DNS and NTP servers must be valid IP addresses
6. CIDR notation must be valid (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24)

## Network Configuration Rules
1. Management Network is always required
2. vMotion, Replication, and Uplink networks can use Management network settings
3. If not using Management network settings, all network fields become required
4. Network Extension requires at least one IP
5. HA Network Extension requires additional HA IPs
6. Gateway IP must be in the same subnet as the network
7. Network mask must be valid (e.g., 255.255.255.0)

## State Management
1. All form data must be saved in the Project Context
2. Form validation should happen on field change
3. Error messages must be displayed under the respective fields
4. Default values should be used for new entries
5. State updates must be atomic
6. Preserve state during page navigation

## UI/UX Guidelines
1. Use TabView for multiple vCenters
2. Use Card components for form sections
3. Group related fields together
4. Show confirmation dialog before deletions
5. Display validation errors immediately after field changes
6. Provide clear success/error feedback
7. Implement progressive disclosure for complex forms

## Error Handling
1. Display user-friendly error messages
2. Log technical errors for debugging
3. Provide recovery options when possible
4. Handle network timeouts gracefully
